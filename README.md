#Kicktext is a markdown preview and transformation tool, for GNOME

##Why?

Because you shouldn't need to change your text editor to get a Markdown preview.

##Status

It's pretty bare at the moment, but here's what works now:

* Open a markdown file, and see the resulting HTML (rendered via WebKit)
* Automatically reloading a file when it changes

What I'd like to add, before minting version 1.0:

* HTML themes (which the user can add to)
* Extensible transformation tools (plus built-in support for AsciiDoc)
* pygments for github-style syntax coloring.

It's not my goal to create a 1:1 copy, but the core concept is definitely inspired by Brett Terpstra's [Marked](http://markedapp.com). Thank you!
